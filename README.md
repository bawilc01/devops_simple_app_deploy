deploy an app using terraform to a kubernetes cluster
this readme is functioning as a to do list for now

# step 1: write golang api app 
I am trying to get acquainted with Golang. The app is a simple, RESTful api that reads an articles array and performs CRUD operations. No backend db at this time.

# step 2: configure kubernetes
learning kubernetes, not sure yet if there's anything to deploy here

# step 3: write terraform script to deploy the app in kubernetes cluster
have familiarity with terraform; will figure out how to deploy to k8s 

# run app in kubernetes
will need to update readme with run instructions

# add db backend for saving CRUD operations
will use mysql or postgres; 
may explore nosql option such as mongo
