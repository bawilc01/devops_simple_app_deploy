# devops_simple_app_deploy
Goal: Deploy an app inside kubernetes cluster with terraform using github actions
This readme is functioning as a to do list for now.

# Step 1: write golang api app 
I am trying to get acquainted with Golang. The app is a simple, RESTful api that reads an articles array and performs CRUD operations. No backend db at this time.

# Step 2: create kubernetes cluster for app
Learning kubernetes, not sure yet if there's anything to deploy here except maybe a kube config file.

# Step 3: Write terraform script to deploy the app using github actions ci/cd
Have familiarity with terraform and github actions separately.

# Step 4: add db backend for saving CRUD operations
will use mysql or postgres; 
may explore nosql option such as mongo
